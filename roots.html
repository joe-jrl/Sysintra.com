                    <h2> Discovering Our Inner Self </h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Life is a continuous journey in search of our true selves. Do our roots define us, or are 
                        we merely embedded in the surrounding mass shaping us while still having the ability to 
                        change our lives? Simone de Beauvoir once said, "One is not born but rather becomes a woman." 
                        This is a profound thought that applies not just to women, but to every living creature. As 
                        human beings, we can reflect and change our pathways. Ultimately, we are meant to change; 
                        that is the essence of evolution. As an immigrant, I had to let go of some aspects of my 
                        cultural background to fit into my new environment. I was also curious about this different 
                        world. However, immigration has helped me look deeper into myself and discover who I truly am.
                        The discovery is very simple, I am the human being first. The definition of state became 
                        fluid for me, it doesn't mean I deny where I was born, but rather it doesn't define me or 
                        anyone else unless that is their choice.

                        My homeland is the forest, a place where I have spent a lot of time with my family. The smell 
                        of pine, the songs of birds, and walking on soft moss always make me feel grounded, no matter 
                        where I am in the world. I also feel a strong nostalgia for the regional food from my 
                        upbringing, and I am still quite confident when speaking my native language however my 
                        background does not define my way of seeing the world. I have a deep curiosity for the 
                        unknown, and I refuse to limit myself to society's expectations. It's not worth sacrificing 
                        our true selves to fit someone else's mold.  Living away from my homeland has given me the 
                        freedom to define who I am. Although this has been an ongoing process and it has been a truly 
                        beautiful experience. As I navigate my middle age, I've reached a point where I consciously 
                        choose what I take pride in and what my priorities are. I'm not suggesting that there is a 
                        right or wrong way to live; rather, I believe that a different perspective might help us 
                        make decisions about what is truly good for us.
