          I am Anabel. I feel very lucky to live in East London, where I can witness a vibrant multicultural microcosm
          that inspires my creativity. Recently, I returned to my old passion for writing, focusing on my experiences in
          the world and the hope I see emerging in this chaotic and contradictory environment. I aim for my blog to
          inspire others to reflect on their own thoughts.
