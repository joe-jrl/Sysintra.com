                       Becoming a mother is a true revolution in a woman's life. One would say birth is the 
                       fundamental act essential for the survival and continuation of a species. It sounds so 
                       basic but if it comes to a human being when our pelvises are generally smaller and more 
                       compact compared to the pelvises of many other mammals. Then we have to carry a heavy pregnancy 
                       only on two legs, not four. Human recovery from pregnancy is much longer and giving birth is 
                       very dangerous and brutal. What differentiates us from other species is advanced cognitive 
                       abilities, complex language, social structures, and capacity for cultural evolution. I would 
                       assume that complex reasoning, a sense of morality, and ethics would help us women to be 
                       supported by society through this hard brutal  time and trying to adapt to the new reality. 
                       But the more advanced and wealthy society, the woman is becoming more lonely as a mum and 
                       less help she gets from the village. Which doesn't make this hard time enough. Yes, the 
                       healthcare is much more advanced to keep us and our babies alive and healthy, physically 
                       yes we are looked after much better than our mums and grannies but mentally woman is neglected, 
                       abandoned and left alone, the state mainly offers expensive childcare to be able to get back 
                       to work if we can't effort it we don't have much choice. Society offer woman  endless advises 
                       and tips  how to do things better, better means their way.

                        I remember when struggling the breastfeeding I asked for help  the charity group who were
                        supporting women in breastfeeding. A lovely lady came to my house and said that the pain is 
                        normal and is normal to be sad and to feel frustrated but I am not alone in this pain because 
                        she is there for me and there is always formula if  it is too much for me. These magic words 
                        helped me to accept the situation, changed everything and I magically have found my own way 
                        to feed my baby. Two books about breastfeeding and many advises and opinions  from others 
                        were a waste of time and  only put more pressure on me.

                       New mum doesn't need people around her with their better experiences and “wisdom” she needs 
                       to know she is not alone and she will find her own strength.  The village shouldn't judge, 
                       put pressure, the village should be there for woman giving her freedom of choice. The birth 
                       is not just giving birth to a baby ,the mother is reborn herself we should support her with 
                       this transformation so she can regrow stronger to become newer and more herself. The concept 
                       of the village has changed, the village is everyone around the new mum, village is the state 
                       which creates the legislation, village is the school , the village is the employer, village is 
                       the guy passing by, a  man who could spare grim look at woman who is trying to handle toddler's 
                       tantrum in the middle of the pavement.  As a human species we are holding unique gifts, we 
                       are capable to understand and share the feeling of others,  a new mum needs others compassion 
                       a lot. Strangely enough I witnessed example of love and compassion watching family of elephants 
                       in Kenya. The way how they look after each other can teach us humans and remind us that simple 
                       gestures not necessarily verbal  makes huge difference.
