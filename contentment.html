                        A few years ago in Lisbon, I was sitting in a small café when I noticed a man coming in from a nearby roadwork site. He caught my eye because he wore oversized trousers held up with a rope instead of a belt. He ordered octopus salad and bread, and ate his meal slowly, enjoying every bite. When his coffee came, he took his time with it, while
                        sunlight was warming his face. Watching him, I felt I was seeing someone who was truly
                        at peace with himself.

                    <p>
                        In London's West End, the same octopus salad would be
                        an expensive status symbol instead of a simple pleasure. But real status comes from within. We choose what feels like luxury. When we are true to ourselves, we show our real worth. A dignified mindset doesn't need to look down on others or impress others; it shares joy just like the
                        Portuguese man did, even without realizing it.
