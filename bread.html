                        I grew up in Eastern Europe in the 1980s. I remember 
                        a little cooperative bakery located on the side of my little town. 
                        A steep staircase led to a place of magic filled
                        with fresh sourdough bread. The smell of freshly 
                        baked bread spread around, and the crust on the
                        bread was tempting kids to peel it off first and eat 
                        it with crunching sound in their mouths   
                        The empty shelves in the shops in the 1980s reflected the 
                        deep recession deepening the country after the long communist regime. 
                        The sharp, unpleasant voice of
                        the soviet shop assistant deciding who would
                        get stock hidden under the counter reminded people that they were fooled 
                        by the 'people' party. But this little bakery was different, sourdough bread was always there, 
                        the old salesman welcomed everyone, and he was selling 
                        not only bread but stories. He treated everyone special,
                        he put love into every single loaf picking it from the metal rack. The  
                        bakery was the place of dignity and respect 
                        and the old baker nourished people not only body but also their soul.   
                        Every time I walk into my local bakery shop
                        in East London I smile and the feel same sensation of joy. 
                        The lady is always welcoming me with a big smile and she always exchanges a 
                        few kinds of words with each customer.

                    <h2>Bread the same as love takes time and patience to cultivate</h2>

                        The history of bread is 15,000 years old. Very coarse flatbread, later became lighter when natural 
                        fermentation helped to rise. This very simple way of producing food which contains flour and water 
                        has been feeding mankind for ages. It kept us nourished and full. But traditional bakeries became 
                        niche and luxury. We replace simple bread with products packed in plastic filled with a list of 
                        chemical ingredients that taste of nothing.    The simplicity of life is an important necessity. 
                        It is filling our lives with memories and moments of joy and it is definitely moving our senses 
                        and connecting us to other people. Bread is not just a bread. Going to the bakery requires us to 
                        physically walk there, paying for this bread so we are helping local business owner to make living 
                        by producing something with passion . Heading to the bakery ,talking to the people or simply 
                        reflecting and feeling the moment is crucial for our mental health. The ritual of cutting the bread 
                        and sharing it with family and friends will create beautiful memories of togetherness and sharing. 
                        No is not just a bread.
