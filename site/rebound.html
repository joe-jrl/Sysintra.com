                        Elena woke later than she meant to. The room still carried the heaviness of yesterday, as 
                        if sleep had failed to rinse it away. She had flown home past midnight, the journey stretching 
                        endlessly with delays and stale airport air. Her body felt bruised by exhaustion. Her mind 
                        throbbed with a dull, emotional hangover blend of frustration, sorrow, and something heavier 
                        she couldn&#8217;t yet name.
                    </p> 
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        She had gone back to her hometown in Spain for a funeral. An old friend had died.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p> 
                        They hadn&#8217;t spoken in years, not really, but this was the first loss Elena had ever faced, and 
                        it landed with unexpected force. Grief arrived not as a single feeling, but as fragments. 
                        Flickers of the past broke through her thoughts like photographs scattered in her mind: crowded 
                        parties, cigarettes smoked behind the church while mass droned on inside, camping trips with 
                        mornings begun with coffee brewed over a flame and conversations that felt endless. With 
                        Valeria, there had only ever been joy, uncomplicated, alive.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        At the funeral, Elena met Valeria&#8217;s husband for the first time. He surprised her. He was 
                        gentle, soft-spoken, the kind of man who seemed to listen more than he spoke. It felt almost 
                        unreal when they were young, Valeria had gravitated toward loud, self-absorbed men, the 
                        kind who took up space and demanded attention. That pattern had helped shape her fierce 
                        feminist convictions — yet she had never quite escaped it. Valeria had been well at the end. 
                        She had been cared for, quietly, without conditions. Elena felt grateful for that. Valeria 
                        had always been the one who showed up for others; it felt right that someone had finally 
                        shown up for her.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>    
                        After a long shower, the steam clinging to her skin like a second layer, Elena made her way 
                        to the kitchen. It stopped her short. The counters were spotless, the sink empty, the usual 
                        chaos erased. Her partner was not a tidy man. Their arguments often began here, over 
                        abandoned mugs and crumbs left behind like evidence.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>   
                        In the center of the counter lay a letter, written in his familiar hand.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p> 
                        She waited until the coffee finished brewing before opening it. She already knew what it 
                        would say. They hadn&#8217;t written love letters in years — only messages of logistics, apologies 
                        that led nowhere, silences that stretched too long. Whatever love had once lived between 
                        them had slowly drained away.  
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>    
                        As she read, sadness settled in, but relief followed close behind, unexpected and undeniable. 
                        For years, she had imagined a life shared with a man like her father: steady, caring, present. 
                        Instead, she had spent the last decade with someone fueled by adrenaline and unpredictability, 
                        mistaking intensity for connection.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>    
                        She folded the letter carefully and set it down. Outside, morning had fully arrived. And for 
                        the first time in a long while, the quiet didn&#8217;t feel empty.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        It felt like space.    
                    </p>
